Creating a game is an elaborate task that will require a combination of assets and code. To
create assets and code, we'll need some pretty advanced tools, including art tools, sound
tools, level-editing tools, and code-editing tools. Assets include any visual artwork (2D sprites,
3D models), audio (music and sound effects), and game levels. To perform that, we'll set up
a C++ coding environment to build our UE4 applications. We'll download Visual Studio 2015,
install it, and set it up for UE4 C++ coding. (Visual Studio is an essential package for code
editing when editing the C++ code for your UE4 game.)
